Conflicts can be entered on the site and the current and past duty calendars can be viewed as well.

title::RoadTrip
strID::roadTrip

demoLink::
descMain::RoadTrip was another student project created for CS330 that, when the API keys were active, allowed for users to plan a road trip from two locations and receive weather projections for various locations on their route at the time they would be in that area.  The app used Google Maps API to calculate the shortest driving route between two points in the United States and Accuweather API to find the weather forecast for incremental locations at the time the user was expected to arrive.
descMore::RoadTrip was a collaborative project with Ryan Ehrhardt and was designed to showcase our capability to use and create APIs in an online application.  A Python Flask server is used to serve information to the users and also request information from the external APIs.  The server serves simply as the messenger between the APIs and the user and, as such, most of the heavy lifting, including displaying the route and adding weather pins is handled client-side.
